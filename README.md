# face_mask_detector

Tensorflow(Keras) used to create neural network that detects and classifies faces as with mask/without mask.

Preprocessing - Resizing, Augmentation and compression as .npy file
Training - Trained for 20 Epochs using keras to create neural networks
Detection - Can detect and classify faces in pictures as well as live web cam videos
